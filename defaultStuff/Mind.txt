Ideal text box should be an independent object (like class) that
	displayed the string inside of its boundaries. has a scroll
	bar weather it can scroll or not but if the text is to tall
	to fit in then have scroll bar be movable and effectable.
	I just hate when some scroll bars show up and it causes the
	text to fold and shit.
	
	txtBox.draw();
	txtBox.setStringAL(newStringAL);
	txtBox.setStringAR(string[], line);
	txtBox.setString(string, line, subLine);
	ArrayList<String[]> =	txtBox.getStringAL();
	String[] =				txtBox.getStringAR(line);
	String =				txtBox.getString(line, subLine);

	I do not know when I would need to access a subLine of a line...

Want to add buttons
	clickable.
	draw img for it.


Create a txt box that just displays letters in a line.


Method that draws a dotted line. draws a black line, then 4px white lines 8 px appart.
